# Crop Yield Prediction Website

This project is an end-to-end crop yield prediction website developed as the final year bachelor's project with the aim of enhancing agricultural productivity. It utilizes machine learning techniques to predict crop yield based on various factors and provides recommendations for crop selection.

## Dataset Source
The project uses the crop recommendation dataset sourced from Kaggle, available at [Crop Recommendation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakrasmriti/crop-recommendation). This dataset provides information on various agricultural parameters and recommends suitable crops based on soil, climate, and other factors.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend Development:** HTML, CSS, and limited JavaScript were used for application development to create an interactive user interface.
- **Data Visualization:** Extensive data visualization techniques were employed to explore and analyze the dataset effectively.
- **Machine Learning Techniques:** Machine learning algorithms were utilized for crop type classification and yield prediction. Random Forest Classifier (RFC) was used for the multi-class classification problem, while Linear Regression was employed for predicting crop yield.
- **Gradio Framework:** Instead of Flask, the Gradio framework was used to provide an interface for the machine learning models. Gradio offers simplicity and ease of use for creating web interfaces for machine learning models.

## Highlights
- **Classification Model:** The project utilizes Random Forest Classifier (RFC) to classify crop types based on various agricultural parameters.
- **Regression Model:** Linear Regression is employed to predict crop yield, taking into account factors such as soil type, climate, and crop variety.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Various data visualization techniques are highlighted to provide insights into the dataset, aiding in feature selection and model training.

## Future Work
Future work for the project involves deploying the machine learning models over the cloud to improve scalability and accessibility. By deploying the models on the cloud, the project aims to reach a wider audience and further enhance agricultural productivity.
